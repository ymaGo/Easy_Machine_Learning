# Easy_Machine_Learning

This Repo is used to record the studying process of Machine Learning Algorithms by extremely small data set.

I want to concentrate to fully understand the mathmatics under the algorithms but not the programming process.

For some machine learning algorithms, I created the xlxs file to realize the algorithm at the same time, this is veryhelpfull for me to understand the algorithm.

I did this job one year ago.

Hope they are usefull to you.
